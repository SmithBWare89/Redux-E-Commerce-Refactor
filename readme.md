# [Redux E-Commerce Refactor](https://github.com/SmithBWare89/Redux-E-Commerce-Refactor) -- [Deployed](https://redux-ecommerce-refactor.herokuapp.com/)

## Description
This project is intended to be a demonstration of refactoring a Context API to one that uses a Redux store. For this project we were provided starter code of an e-commerce side that we added state management to throughout the module. As students we were challenged with reading the Redux documentation to increase our understanding of another package that performs similar functionality while also increasing our exposure to how developers will have to parse through documentation they may be unfamiliar with to resolve an issue in development. It's intended that when reviewing the code behind this project that you'll find a refactored code document that uses Redux to handle state management for the web application.

## User Story
```
AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
```
